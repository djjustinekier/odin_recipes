            <li>1 tsp Italian seasoning</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp salt</li>
            <li>1/4 tsp black pepper</li>
            <li>1/4 tsp red pepper flakes (optional)</li>
            <li>2 large eggs</li>
            <li>1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
            <li>1/2 cup ricotta cheese</li>
            <li>2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
            <li>Cooking spray</li>

    <h2>Steps:</h2>

            <li>Preheat the oven to 350°F (175°C).</li>
            <li>Cook the spaghetti according to the package instructions. Drain and set aside.</li>
            <li>In a large skillet, brown the ground beef over medium-high heat, breaking it up with a spatula. Add the onion, bell pepper, and garlic, and cook for 5-7 minutes, or until the vegetables are tender.</li>
            <li>Add the diced tomatoes, tomato sauce, Italian seasoning, salt, black pepper, and red pepper flakes (if using) to the skillet. Stir to combine and bring the mixture to a simmer. Let it cook for 10-15 minutes, or until the sauce has thickened.</li>
            <li>In a large mixing bowl, whisk the eggs, Parmesan cheese, and ricotta cheese together.</li>
            <li>Add the cooked spaghetti to the bowl and toss to coat the noodles with the cheese mixture.</li>
            <li>Grease a 9-inch pie dish with cooking spray. Arrange half of the spaghetti mixture in the bottom of the dish.</li>
            <li>Spoon half of the meat sauce over the spaghetti layer.</li>
            <li>Sprinkle 1 cup of shredded mozzarella cheese over the meat sauce.</li>
            <li>Repeat the layers with the remaining spaghetti mixture, meat sauce, and mozzarella cheese.</li>
            <li>Cover the dish with foil and bake for 25 minutes.</li>
            <li>Remove the foil and bake for an additional 10-15 minutes, or until the cheese is melted and golden brown.</li>
            <li>Let the spaghetti pie cool for a few minutes before slicing and serving.</li>
        </ol>
