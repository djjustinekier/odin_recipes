    <h1>Hakarl</h1>
    <img src="../images/hakarl.jpg">
    <em>Hakarl is a traditional Icelandic dish made from fermented shark meat. The shark is typically the Greenland shark, which has a high content of urea and trimethylamine oxide, making the meat toxic if consumed fresh. The fermentation process helps to break down the toxins and preserve the meat. The flavor of hakarl is quite strong and pungent, and it is often described as an acquired taste.</em>
